# Learning Journal: 
## Day 8 at Code Fellows 201

Today I was pleased to say I felt like I was following along on events and forms. They made sense to me and I was able to do the demo along with Allie, which is always the best practice for me. 

Also, Allie tipped me off this afternoon to the generally more quiet kitchen for lab hours. That helped a ton. 

Thing that both killed me and amazed me was how hard it was to do the table code for the HTML and the darn table footer totals. I was so close and then broke it a ton and just ended up going back to my original code. ARGH. 

But I did love figuring out so much of the table stying on my own and the finishing touches with Megan. It felt fun. 

*Side Note*
Crappy timing - I think I dislocated my first or second rib tonight reaching for a plate in a cabinet. I had to use heat and take some meds - so that may be why I couldn't fix my errors tonight. Tomorrow will be a better day.
