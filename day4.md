# Learning Journal: 
## Day 4 at Code Fellows 201

Today was the day that nearly broke me. I had an array guessing question in my about me quiz that WOULD NOT WORK. And everytime I did fix it, I broke three other things. 

As the staff at school had predicted, I questioned my choices, my ability and even my sanity.

But wow! That feeling of finally understanding the problems with help of several TAs, and then - even better - solving new problems on my own? INCREDIBLE!

Today I enjoyed learning about loops and css and more about html.

All of my day was spent on Lab 3 so I'm really behind now and hoping I have enough time tonight to catch up.

I'll say it again. It's hard to feel behind. Normally, I'm an A student. But I'm trying to not be too hard on myself. It's only the first week and I'll improve and get faster over time.
