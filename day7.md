# Learning Journal: 
## Day 7 at Code Fellows 201

Today was great to be on site with everyone, but definitely some adjustments. I really like being able to pause and rewind the the lectures. Also, my back much prefers me working at home. I forgot how painful being on site (any site) can be for me. Tonight I ordered a few more tools to make it more comfortable that I should have by the end of week. 

I also honestly was surprised at how distracting I found the coworking space. I've worked in coffee shops and such and I found this easily twice as distracting as that. So I've ordered headphones (mine weren't cutting it) with proper noise cancellation.

The thing that made me sad today was seeing my classmates feeling disheartened and discouraged. I'm a bit of a natural cheerleader and I want everyone to know they're going to make it, even if it doesn't feel that way now. But I guess the best I can really do is be there and show my path as an example of the struggle and growth mind set. 

I'm still struggling with how to talk about constructor funcitons, methods, objects and variables and their relationship to each other, but I figure the more I practice the better I'll get. 

*Side Note*
I thought I'd finally figured out the git stuff today and then I had a weird merge error and pull request and I can't figure out how to fix it without loosing all my new app.js code. 

PS - I would hate to objectify a person so I've decided that TAs are a constructor function and you, Mike are a new instance of that function! (is that right?!?)
