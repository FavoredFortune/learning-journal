# Learning Journal: 
## Day 2 at Code Fellows 201

Today I woke up with a cold and quickly got a fever. So I stayed home and slept through the morning and already missed class. 

I'm so glad that class is recorded! 

Learned about arrays, booleans, and git hub repositories and ACP.

Also learned that something as simple as copy/paste my own code into another window can sometimes help me see my own errors. 

*Personal learning:*
To get Harley calm when I'm studying, I simply **HAVE TO** stop and play with him for 10 minutes. Then I can have up to an hour of uninterrupted work time. It's really not so bad; I just have to get used to it.
