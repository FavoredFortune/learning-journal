# Learning Journal: 
## Day 5 at Code Fellows 201

This weekend I'm excited to get fully caught up and have my feet better under me for next week.
I slept through most of Friday to help me recover from my flu and working hard to get all my homework done today so I can focus on lab 5 and re-reading my content tomorrow. 

While I'm still feeling unsteady on functions and loops I'm feeling a lot more confident in the basics, including git hub (despite my score on Quiz 2). I plan to retake both Quiz 1 and 2 tomorrow evening. 

Sadly, my fever is back this afternoon, but I'm hoping it will be short-lived.
