# Learning Journal: 
## Day 6 at Code Fellows 201

Today I'm finally starting to feel better physically. I can mostly breathe again and I have only sneezed twice today. It's kind of radical.

Today I'm also getting more comfortable with feeling unsteady on concepts and continuing to forge ahead, trusting that I'll figure it out eventually. It is a good feeling. Less panic. Less "What have I done?" thoughts and more like "Okay, I don't get this YET." It's that growth mindset Brandy covered on day one. I AM LIVING IT!

I feel like I have a pretty solid grasp on an object, if not everything that belongs within one and on dot notation of a method. There is still a lot of fuzziness on the relationship of all the parts to each other, but I'm thinking with more time to plan, pseduocode and code tomorrow I'll be doing better.

*Side Note*
I keep messing up on directories and files when I try to move things or copy things and move them somewhere else. I am sure it something very basic. Looking forward to having TA Mike help me with that tomorrow.  Would a TA be an object or Mike? Which is a method of which? Random thought for the night that proves I need to go to bed.
