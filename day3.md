# Learning Journal: 
## Day 3 at Code Fellows 201

Today had plusses and minuses. I was stoked to be able to finish my lab2 work pretty early in the day. I still have to work on not going overboard on projects. 

Today I enjoyed learning about loops and css and more about html.

I found the CSS really interesting as some of it is newer to me.

Tonight I'm struggling to understand loops. I thought I did, but I can't make my do while loop work. I'm waiting on help from a TA now. 

It's hard to feel behind. Normally, I'm an A student. But I'm trying to not be too hard on myself. It's only the first week and I'll improve and get faster over time.
